The *explicit* Human-in-the-Loop process currently requires the [QuestionnaireToolkit](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/questionnairetoolkit-157330) to receive explicit subjective feedback by users (e.g., measuring the usability of a design using the System Usability Scale).

This feedback is used as design objective value in the optimization process.

There is currently no *implicit* variant of this asset that can, for example, process the user's physiology as input for the design target values.
